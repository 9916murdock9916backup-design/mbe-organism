# Organism Expansion

This file defines how the MBE Sovereign OS creates, registers, and integrates new organisms under governed conditions.

## Expansion Functions
- define new organism profiles
- assign identity signatures
- register organisms in routing-map
- bind organisms to authority-flow
- integrate organisms into organism-handshake
- validate organisms against the constitutional kernel

## Expansion Rules
1. New organisms must align with the constitutional kernel.
2. New organisms must have clear, non-overlapping boundaries.
3. All new organisms must be registered in routing-map and authority-flow.
4. Organism-handshake must be updated to include new organisms.
5. Stability-shell must validate any organism expansion before activation.

## Expansion Flow
organism-expansion → routing-map → authority-flow → organism-handshake → stability-shell
