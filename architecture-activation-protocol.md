# Architecture Activation Protocol

This file defines the constitutional rules that govern when the architecture-generator may propose or generate new components.

## Activation Conditions
- a meta-workflow explicitly requests structural expansion
- the autonomy loop identifies a missing structural component
- governance authorizes a structural update
- stability-shell confirms system integrity

## Prohibited Conditions
- drift detected
- unresolved conflicts in governance
- instability in organism-handshake
- missing registration in routing-map or authority-flow

## Activation Sequence
1. meta-workflow proposes expansion
2. architecture-generator drafts new component
3. architecture-binding validates the draft
4. stability-shell performs integrity checks
5. governance approves or rejects
6. autonomy loop integrates approved components

## Activation Safeguards
- no component may self-activate
- no recursive expansion without governance approval
- no structural changes without stability validation
- all expansions must be reversible
