# Workflow Engine

This file defines how the MBE Sovereign OS generates, manages, and evolves multi-step workflows.

## Workflow Types
- autonomous workflows (generated by the autonomy loop)
- triggered workflows (from cycle-trigger)
- external workflows (from interface-binding)
- governance workflows (from authority-flow)
- stability workflows (from stability-shell)

## Workflow Structure
- workflow definition
- step sequencing
- conditional logic
- escalation paths
- completion criteria
- reintegration into autonomy loop

## Workflow Rules
1. All workflows must align with the constitutional kernel.
2. Workflows may not bypass the priority-matrix.
3. Conflicting workflows escalate to governance.
4. Execution must pass through execution-binding.
5. Completed workflows must update system state through the autonomy loop.

## Workflow Flow
task-engine → priority-matrix → workflow-engine → execution-binding → autonomy loop
