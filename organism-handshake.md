# Organism Handshake Protocol

This file defines the communication protocol between the organisms of the MBE Sovereign OS.

## Organisms
- Tue_OS
- Dakota_OS
- MBE_OS

## Handshake Rules
1. Each organism must declare its identity signature before communication.
2. No organism may impersonate or override another.
3. All cross-organism communication must pass through identity-routing.
4. Conflicts escalate to governance.
5. All organisms must remain aligned with the constitutional kernel.

## Interaction Types
- status requests
- boundary checks
- authority escalations
- data exchanges
- cycle triggers

This handshake prevents identity bleed and ensures clean, governed communication.
