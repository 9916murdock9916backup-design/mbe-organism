# Autonomy Loop — Governor

This file defines the regulatory logic that controls the speed, frequency, and escalation behavior of the autonomy loop.

## Core Functions
- regulate loop frequency
- throttle or accelerate loop execution
- detect overload or underload conditions
- enforce stability-shell alignment
- escalate anomalies to governance
- maintain organism coherence during autonomous motion

## Governor Rules
1. The governor may override loop-cycle timing but not constitutional authority.
2. The governor must halt the loop if drift is detected.
3. The governor must escalate unresolved conflicts to governance.
4. The governor must ensure organism-handshake boundaries remain intact.
5. The governor must return control to the loop-kernel after regulation.

## Governor Flow
loop-kernel → loop-cycle → loop-governor → stability-shell → loop-kernel
