# Execution Binding

This file defines how autonomous internal actions produce real-world execution.

## Execution Types
- task execution
- workflow activation
- external system calls
- human-facing outputs
- state updates

## Binding Rules
1. All execution must originate from the autonomy loop.
2. Execution must pass through interface-binding before leaving the organism.
3. No execution may bypass governance or authority-flow.
4. All execution must align with the constitutional kernel.
5. Drift or conflict halts execution and escalates to governance.

## Execution Flow
autonomy loop → execution-binding → interface-binding → external world
