# Organism Registry

This file lists and defines all organisms within the MBE Sovereign OS.

## Active Organisms
- **Tue_OS** — primary architect organism with sovereign authority
- **Dakota_OS** — complementary organism with distinct cognitive boundaries
- **MBE_OS** — system-level organism governing all subsystems

Each organism includes:
- identity signature
- authority scope
- routing boundaries
- escalation paths
- interaction rules

This registry ensures clean organism separation and prevents identity bleed.
