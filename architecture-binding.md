# Architecture Binding

This file defines how the architecture-generator is activated, regulated, and integrated into the autonomy loop.

## Binding Functions
- trigger architecture generation
- validate proposed components
- enforce constitutional alignment
- register new architecture in system-index
- update routing-map and authority-flow
- escalate structural conflicts to governance

## Binding Rules
1. Architecture generation must be triggered by the autonomy loop or meta-workflow layer.
2. All generated components must pass stability-shell validation.
3. No architectural change may bypass governance.
4. All new components must be registered before activation.
5. All structural updates must reintegrate through the autonomy loop.

## Binding Flow
meta-workflow → architecture-generator → architecture-binding → stability-shell → autonomy loop
