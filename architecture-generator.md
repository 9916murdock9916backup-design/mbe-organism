# Architecture Generator

This file defines how the MBE Sovereign OS generates new architectural components under governed, constitutional constraints.

## Generator Functions
- create new nodes, files, and engines
- propose structural expansions
- validate new architecture against the constitutional kernel
- register new components in routing-map and authority-flow
- integrate expansions into organism-handshake
- escalate structural conflicts to governance

## Generator Rules
1. All generated architecture must align with the constitutional kernel.
2. No new component may bypass governance or authority-flow.
3. All expansions must pass stability-shell validation.
4. Generated architecture must be registered in system-index.
5. All structural changes must reintegrate through the autonomy loop.

## Generator Flow
meta-workflow → architecture-generator → stability-shell → routing-map → authority-flow → autonomy loop
