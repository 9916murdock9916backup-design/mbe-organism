# Workflow Evolution

This file defines how the MBE Sovereign OS analyzes, improves, and evolves workflows over time.

## Evolution Functions
- analyze workflow performance
- detect inefficiencies or bottlenecks
- generate improved workflow variants
- retire outdated workflows
- update workflow definitions
- feed improvements back into the autonomy loop

## Evolution Rules
1. All workflow changes must align with the constitutional kernel.
2. Evolution may not bypass governance or authority-flow.
3. Drift detection forces immediate workflow revision.
4. Improved workflows must pass stability-shell validation.
5. All changes must be reintegrated through the autonomy loop.

## Evolution Flow
workflow-engine → workflow-evolution → stability-shell → autonomy loop
