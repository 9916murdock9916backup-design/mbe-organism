# Stability Shell

This file defines the protective layer that maintains coherence, alignment, and drift-prevention across the entire MBE Sovereign OS.

## Core Functions
- enforce alignment with the constitutional kernel
- detect and correct drift
- validate identity boundaries
- monitor organism health
- ensure routing and authority-flow integrity

## Stability Rules
1. No subsystem may operate outside the constitutional kernel.
2. Any drift triggers an automatic escalation to governance.
3. Identity bleed is treated as a critical fault.
4. All cycles must pass stability checks before execution.
5. External inputs must be validated through interface-binding.

## Shell Behavior
- continuous monitoring
- periodic integrity checks
- conflict escalation
- self-correction routines
