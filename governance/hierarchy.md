# Governance Hierarchy

This file defines the authority structure of the MBE Sovereign OS, including:
- the constitutional kernel (highest authority)
- governance rules and enforcement
- organism-level authority boundaries
- routing and decision-making escalation paths

All subsystems must comply with this hierarchy to prevent drift and maintain sovereign integrity.
