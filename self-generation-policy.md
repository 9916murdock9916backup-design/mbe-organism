# Self-Generation Policy

This file defines the constitutional boundaries and permissions for autonomous architectural generation.

## Allowed Generations
- new workflow types
- new task categories
- new organism profiles
- new structural nodes that fill explicit gaps
- new engines that extend existing capabilities

## Forbidden Generations
- recursive self-replication without governance approval
- deletion or mutation of constitutional files
- changes to authority-flow or governance hierarchy
- any expansion that introduces drift or instability
- any component that bypasses stability-shell validation

## Generation Triggers
- meta-workflow identifies a structural gap
- autonomy loop detects repeated failure patterns
- governance authorizes expansion
- stability-shell confirms system integrity

## Generation Safeguards
- all expansions must be reversible
- all expansions must be logged
- all expansions must be validated before activation
- all expansions must reintegrate through the autonomy loop
