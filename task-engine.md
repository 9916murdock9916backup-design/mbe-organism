# Task Engine

This file defines how the MBE Sovereign OS generates, evaluates, prioritizes, and executes tasks.

## Task Types
- autonomous tasks (generated by the autonomy loop)
- triggered tasks (from cycle-trigger)
- external tasks (from interface-binding)
- governance tasks (from authority-flow)
- stability tasks (from stability-shell)

## Task Lifecycle
1. task creation
2. task evaluation
3. priority assignment
4. execution routing
5. execution
6. result capture
7. loop reintegration

## Task Rules
1. All tasks must align with the constitutional kernel.
2. Tasks may not bypass authority-flow.
3. Conflicting tasks escalate to governance.
4. Execution must pass through execution-binding.
5. Completed tasks must re-enter the autonomy loop for state updates.

## Task Flow
task-engine → execution-binding → interface-binding → external world → autonomy loop
