# Identity Map

This file defines the core identities within the MBE Sovereign OS, including:

- **Tue_OS** — primary architect identity and sovereign authority
- **Dakota_OS** — complementary organism with distinct cognitive boundaries
- **MBE_OS** — the overarching system identity that governs all subsystems

Each identity has:
- a defined scope
- a routing signature
- authority boundaries
- escalation paths

This map ensures clean, non‑bleeding identity separation across the organism.
