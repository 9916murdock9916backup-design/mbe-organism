# Authority Flow

This file defines how authority moves through the MBE Sovereign OS.

## Core Authority Path
1. constitutional kernel (highest authority)
2. governance hierarchy
3. identity-routing
4. organisms
5. automation
6. interfaces (lowest authority)

## Escalation Rules
- Lower layers must escalate conflicts upward.
- Higher layers may override lower layers.
- No layer may bypass the constitutional kernel.

## Drift Prevention
- All decisions must align with the constitutional kernel.
- Any conflict triggers an automatic escalation to governance.
