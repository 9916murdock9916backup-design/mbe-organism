# Automation Cycles

This file defines the recurring system cycles that maintain motion within the MBE Sovereign OS.

## Core Cycles
- **Stability Cycle** — ensures the system remains aligned with the constitutional kernel.
- **Routing Cycle** — verifies identity boundaries and prevents cross‑organism bleed.
- **Governance Cycle** — enforces hierarchy, resolves conflicts, and escalates decisions.
- **Organism Cycle** — maintains organism health, boundaries, and interaction rules.

Each cycle includes:
- trigger conditions
- execution steps
- authority boundaries
- escalation paths
- drift‑prevention logic
